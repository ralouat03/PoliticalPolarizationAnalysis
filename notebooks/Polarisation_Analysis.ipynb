    "# Political Polarization and Economic Factors (GINI & CPI) in OECD Countries\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook investigates the potential relationships between key economic indicators and political polarization within OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) member countries. Specifically, we aim to explore whether income inequality, as measured by the **GINI coefficient**, and inflation, as measured by the **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**, correlate with or can help explain variations in political polarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Political polarization, broadly defined as the divergence of political attitudes toward ideological extremes, is a topic of considerable interest in contemporary political science. Understanding its potential drivers, including socio-economic factors, is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Question:** How do income inequality (GINI) and inflation (CPI) relate to the ideological dispersion of political parties in OECD countries?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Sources:**\n",
    "1.  **Manifesto Project Dataset (MPD):** Provides coded data from political party manifestos, including the `rile` score, which estimates a party's position on a left-right ideological scale. This is our primary source for measuring party ideology.\n",
    "2.  **OECD Dataset:** Contains various economic indicators for member countries, including GINI coefficients and CPI data, which serve as our independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology Outline:**\n",
    "1.  **Data Loading and Merging:** Load the pre-merged dataset which combines party-level manifesto data with country-level OECD economic indicators.\n",
    "2.  **Filtering:** Focus the analysis on OECD member countries, based on information within the dataset.\n",
    "3.  **Quantifying Polarization:** Calculate a political polarization score for each country-year. Our chosen measure is the **vote-share weighted standard deviation of party `rile` scores**. This captures the ideological spread of parties, giving more weight to those with greater electoral support.\n",
    "4.  **Dataset Preparation:** Aggregate data to the country-year level, creating a panel dataset for analysis.\n",
    "5.  **Exploratory Analysis:** Conduct correlation analysis to identify linear associations between polarization, GINI, and CPI.\n",
    "6.  **Statistical Modeling:** Employ linear regression models (OLS) to further examine these relationships, assess statistical significance, and quantify potential impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook documents each step of the analysis, from data preparation to the interpretation of results."

    "\n",
    "**Concept of Political Polarization:**\n",
    "Political polarization refers to the extent to which political opinions and party ideologies diverge towards the extremes of a political spectrum and/or cluster into distinct, opposing camps. For this analysis, we focus on **ideological polarization**, specifically the spread of political parties along the left-right dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chosen Measure: Vote-Share Weighted Standard Deviation of Party `rile` Scores**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **`rile` Score:** The Manifesto Project's `rile` score provides a continuous measure of a party's overall ideological position on a left-right scale, derived from the content analysis of their election manifestos. Positive scores indicate a rightward leaning, negative scores a leftward leaning.\n",
    "-   **Standard Deviation:** The standard deviation is a statistical measure of dispersion or spread. A higher standard deviation of `rile` scores among parties in a given country-year indicates greater ideological distance between them.\n",
    "-   **Vote-Share Weighted:** To reflect the political landscape more accurately, the standard deviation is weighted by each party's vote share (`pervote`). This means that the ideological positions of parties with more votes have a greater influence on the overall polarization score. A country with two large, ideologically distant parties would be considered more polarized than a country with one large centrist party and several small, ideologically distant fringe parties.\n",
    "-   **`ddof=0` in `DescrStatsW`:** This argument in `statsmodels.stats.weightstats.DescrStatsW` calculates the weighted standard deviation as if the data represents the entire population (or the specific set of parties in an election), rather than a sample. This is appropriate here as we are characterizing the observed party system in each election.\n",

    "**Process:**\n",
    "1.  Define a function `calculate_weighted_std` that takes a group of parties (for a specific country-year).\n",

    "3.  Ensure at least two valid parties exist to calculate a spread.\n",

    "## 9. Regression Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective:** To move beyond simple correlation and model the relationship between polarization (dependent variable) and our economic indicators (independent variables). Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression allows us to:\n",
    "-   Quantify the relationship (i.e., how much polarization changes for a unit change in GINI or CPI).\n",
    "-   Assess the statistical significance of these relationships (i.e., how likely they are not due to random chance).\n",
    "-   Determine the proportion of variance in polarization that can be explained by the model (R-squared).\n",
    "-   In multiple regression, assess the effect of one independent variable while statistically controlling for others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Models to be Estimated:**\n",
    "1.  **Simple Linear Regression:** `PolarizationScore ~ GINI` (Polarization as a function of GINI alone)\n",
    "2.  **Simple Linear Regression:** `PolarizationScore ~ CPI` (Polarization as a function of CPI alone)\n",
    "3.  **Multiple Linear Regression:** `PolarizationScore ~ GINI + CPI` (Polarization as a function of both GINI and CPI)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Regression Output Terms to Interpret:**\n",
    "-   **`R-squared` / `Adj. R-squared`:** Proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the model. Adjusted R-squared accounts for the number of predictors.\n",
    "-   **`coef` (Coefficient):** The estimated effect of a one-unit increase in an independent variable on the dependent variable.\n",
    "-   **`P>|t|` (p-value):** If low (typically < 0.05), it suggests the coefficient is statistically significantly different from zero.\n",
    "-   **`F-statistic` and `Prob (F-statistic)`:** Test the overall significance of the entire model.\n",
    "-   **`Cond. No.` (Condition Number):** A diagnostic for multicollinearity (high correlation between independent variables). Large values can indicate problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Preparation for Regression:**\n",
    "Ensure no `NaN` or `inf` (infinity) values are present in the subset of data used for regression, as these can cause errors."

    "## 10. Discussion and Conclusion of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "This section synthesizes the results from the correlation and regression analyses to address the research question: *How do income inequality (GINI) and inflation (CPI) relate to the ideological dispersion of political parties in OECD countries?*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Findings (based on the ~102 country-year observations with complete data for Polarization, GINI, and CPI):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Income Inequality (GINI) and Polarization:**\n",
    "    * The Pearson correlation between `PolarizationScore` and `GINI` was very weak and negative (-0.07).\n",
    "    * In both simple linear regression (`PolarizationScore ~ GINI`) and multiple linear regression (`PolarizationScore ~ GINI + CPI`), the GINI coefficient was **not a statistically significant** predictor of political polarization (p-values were high, e.g., ~0.48 in simple regression).\n",
    "    * The R-squared value for the GINI-only model was extremely low (0.005), indicating that GINI explains a negligible fraction of the variance in polarization scores in this dataset.\n",
    "    * **Interpretation:** Within the analyzed sample and timeframe, there is no significant linear statistical evidence to suggest that income inequality, as measured by GINI, is a strong or consistent driver of the observed political polarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Inflation (CPI) and Polarization:**\n",
    "    * The Pearson correlation between `PolarizationScore` and `CPI` was positive and weak-to-moderate (0.29).\n",
    "    * In both simple linear regression (`PolarizationScore ~ CPI`) and multiple linear regression, the CPI was a **statistically significant positive predictor** of political polarization (p-value ~0.003).\n",
    "    * The simple regression model with CPI explained about 8.3% of the variance in polarization (R-squared = 0.083). For each one-unit increase in CPI, the polarization score is predicted to increase by approximately 0.23 points.\n",
    "    * **Interpretation:** There is statistical evidence suggesting that higher levels of inflation (as measured by CPI) are associated with higher levels of political polarization in the OECD countries and years included in this analysis. This relationship persists even when controlling for GINI.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Combined Model (GINI + CPI):**\n",
    "    * The multiple regression model including both GINI and CPI had an R-squared of 0.088. This is only a marginal improvement over the CPI-only model, reinforcing the finding that GINI adds little explanatory power in the presence of CPI.\n",
    "    * CPI remained the only statistically significant predictor in this combined model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall Conclusion from this Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary finding of this analysis is a statistically significant positive association between the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and political polarization (measured as vote-share weighted standard deviation of `rile` scores) in the subset of OECD country-years with complete data. Higher inflation appears to coincide with greater ideological divergence among political parties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, income inequality (GINI coefficient) did not show a statistically significant relationship with political polarization in this particular dataset and analytical framework. The observed correlations and regression coefficients for GINI were small and not statistically distinguishable from zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Limitations and Considerations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Sample Size and Period:** The statistical inferences are based on approximately 102 country-year observations, primarily from the mid-2000s onwards, due to the availability of complete GINI and CPI data. This is a subset of the total period for which polarization data might be available, and findings might not generalize to other periods or if more complete data were available.\n",
    "-   **Explanatory Power (R-squared):** While the relationship with CPI is statistically significant, the R-squared values (around 8-9%) indicate that CPI (and GINI) explain only a small fraction of the total variation in political polarization. This strongly suggests that many other unobserved factors (e.g., institutional characteristics, specific political events, cultural shifts, other economic variables, media landscape) play a more substantial role in driving polarization.\n",
    "-   **Measure of Polarization:** The chosen measure (vote-share weighted standard deviation of `rile`) is one among many. Different operationalizations of polarization (e.g., affective polarization, legislative voting patterns) might yield different results.\n",
    "-   **Linearity Assumption:** The regression models assume linear relationships. The actual relationships might be non-linear or more complex.\n",
    "-   **Correlation vs. Causation:** This analysis identifies associations. It **cannot establish causal links**. For instance, while higher CPI is associated with higher polarization, we cannot conclude that inflation *causes* polarization, or vice-versa. There could be a third factor influencing both, or the relationship could be bidirectional.\n",
    "-   **Omitted Variable Bias:** The exclusion of other relevant variables could bias the estimated coefficients for GINI and CPI.\n",
    "-   **Condition Number:** The regression outputs noted high condition numbers, particularly for the CPI model and the multiple regression model. While `statsmodels` often handles perfect multicollinearity, high condition numbers can suggest that independent variables might be somewhat correlated (though GINI and CPI showed very low correlation with each other directly) or that there are other numerical scaling issues, potentially affecting the stability of coefficient estimates. However, the consistency of the CPI effect across models provides some reassurance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Potential Future Research Directions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Explore alternative or more comprehensive measures of polarization.\n",
    "-   Incorporate a wider range of economic, social, and institutional variables.\n",
    "-   Employ more advanced time-series or panel data techniques to better account for country-specific fixed effects and temporal dynamics (e.g., lagged effects).\n",
    "-   Investigate potential non-linear relationships.\n",
    "-   Conduct case studies of specific countries to understand the mechanisms linking economic conditions to polarization in context.\n",
    "-   Address missing data through imputation techniques if appropriate, to potentially expand the sample size (though this requires careful consideration of assumptions)."
